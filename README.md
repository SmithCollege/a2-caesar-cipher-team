## Reflection Questions

- What was your favorite part of this assignment?

My favorite part was working out how to assign the offset labels in creating a caesar cipher class. I used visualizations for myself and wrote the index assignings based on that, which made the process clearer and easier to follow.

- What was most challenging about this assignment?

This assignment was full of challenges, logistical and programming wise. I had a challenging time with gradle broadly, more specifically the tests class and figuring out how to read the output and adjust my code based on its results. I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how to balance writing the code to do what I want with how the tests were structured, so that was cahllenging. Howver, running the tests pointed out an error that I have made in my ceasar cipher initiation, which hadn't occured to me when coding it. So, it was a helpful and fruitful experience.

- General comments on your experience with this assignment:

I found it scary in the beginning, because dynamic arrays had been what we had mostly talked about in class and caesar cipher was a small example, whereas in this assignment implementing the dynamic array took a significantly small portion of the work, and most of my time working on this assignment went to the details of the caesar cipher class. However, it was a great reminder of object-oriented programming and cross-defining and referencing classes, as it had been a while since I had exercised, so I needed the challenge!
